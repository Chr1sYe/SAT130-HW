    "        This is the third time I have used ChatGPT to assist me in completing the STA course, twice for homework and once for the preview of LEC. My feeling is that I gradually understand how to let it help me understand some problems, instead of telling it all the homework requirements at the beginning and then copying and pasting in its large amount of text. After I have clarified my needs and purposes (such as code or understanding problems), ChatGPT will tell me the answers I want very efficiently and accurately. For such artificial intelligence-assisted tools, my opinion is to use them as much as possible to save time and unnecessary energy, but still have your own thinking. For example, in the early stages of the course, I prefer to use ChatGPT to help me understand and compile the code, because I can't edit it myself now. After understanding and memorizing it again and again, I hope that I can gradually complete the compilation of the code independently in the middle of the course (at least clarify the principles and applications of each basic code) to achieve the purpose of taking this course."
