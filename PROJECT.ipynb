    "Most people would think that the changes in the world are due to the epidemic that started in 2019, which has profoundly affected people's physical and mental health. In this context, I hope to analyze whether vaccination is related to life and health, because this has always been one of the issues that the world, and even every country that has experienced the epidemic, is still discussing. People in most countries are required to be vaccinated compulsorily, which needs to be studied whether it is for scientific analysis or humanitarianism.\n",
    "So, I set the independent variable as the number of vaccinations and the dependent variable as people's life and health index to study the correlation between them. I used box plots as a visual analysis and came to the following conclusions.\n",
    "The distribution of life satisfaction in each vaccination status is generally similar, with close mean and median positions.\n",
    "Regardless of the number of vaccination doses, the median of life satisfaction is between 6 and 7, and the distribution range is wide.\n",
    "The life satisfaction of each group covers the full range of scores from 1 to 10, which shows that the individual differences in life satisfaction are large in all vaccination states.\n",
    "I think this may be because it is not just Covid that affects people's health in the first place, and vaccines are only part of this epidemic, and the interference factors are too large."

    "The second analysis I want to focus on is about social interaction and mental illness. People usually associate mental illness with social interaction and think that they conflict with each other. Many experts will also guide teenagers or people suffering from other conservative mental illnesses to socialize more. But are these two things so related? \n",
    "So, I used loneliness and participation in social activities as independent variables and dependent variables, and used histograms for visualization analysis. The chart shows that people who often socialize and those who basically do not socialize have lower loneliness scores, while people whose social frequency is between the two have higher depression scores. \n",
    "This does make sense. First of all, loneliness and social interaction are not antonyms, but depend on each person's inner thoughts. For example, teenagers who prefer to be alone will have negative emotions if they are forced to socialize by their elders."

    "The third analysis I explored was about the data on friends. This is a controversial question that often comes up among teenagers, how many friends do people need.\n",

    "People with 5 or more friends showed greater changes in satisfaction, which shows that a larger circle of friends does not always mean higher satisfaction.\n",
    "The weak positive correlation means that while there may be a slight trend of more friends leading to higher satisfaction, the effect is not strong or consistent.\n",
